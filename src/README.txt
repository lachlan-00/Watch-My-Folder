Watch My Folder
---------------

Many businesses use laptops with offline files to provide off
site access to their network. Offline files was a lot better
in Windows 7 but still has a lot of reliability issues and has
caused a lot of issues over the last few years.

For organisations that still want mobile access to files but
are sick of the bugs caused by offline files Watch My Folder
is the solution!

About:
 * This simple program will watch a specified folder.
 * While watching, it creates a 1:1 backup of this folder.
 * When files are changed Watch My Folder will create up to 6
   copies of the original backup file to prevent data loss.
 * A big feature over Offline Files was to enable shadow copies
   of network drives which is not possible with offline files.

Settings:
 * FolderPath - The path that you will be watching.
 * BackupPath - The path where the backups are stored.
 * WaitTime - Wait before each folder to reduce network load.
 * SkipFiles - File extensions that will be skipped when found.
   (Single space seperated. ' ')
 * SkipFolders - Skip directories that contains these strings.
   (Four space seperated. '    ')
 * BackupEnabled - Enable/Disable file versioning in the backup folder.
   (eg. file.doc will become file.doc-0.old when replaced)

Supported Variables:
 Variables that can be used in your folder or backup path.
 * Windows Only:
    * %username% - lachlan
    * %userprofile% - C:\Users\lachlan
    * %homeshare% - \\files\staff\lachlan
 * Linux Only:
    * $USER - lachlan
    * $HOME - /home/lachlan

Usage:
 * Extract to your profile (C:\Users\%username%\)
 * Set desired values in the relevant config text file for your OS.
 * Start the program!

Use cases:
 LOCAL -> LOCAL
 LOCAL -> NETWORK (I have used LAN shares and Internet/Sharepoint sites)
 NETWORK -> LOCAL

Memory usage is quite low (2-3mb) while watching and wait times are an effective way of reducing network load. If you are not watching a network folder a lower watch time is recommended.
