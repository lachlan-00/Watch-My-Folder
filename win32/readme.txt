This zip file contains a portable self install of Watch My Folder. It includes python and GTK dependancies so they do not need to be downloaded.

This method in testing has been a lot easier than using an exe build and I have no reason to hide my source.

To INSTALL
----------

-Extract to your desired install location.
-Run configure.bat

Start menu shortcuts are created and you are ready to go.
